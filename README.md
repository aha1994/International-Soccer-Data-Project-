International Soccer Results Exploratory Data Analysis
======================================================

Group project to explore any dataset of interest. Our team chose an
international soccer game result dataset found on kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017
Our goal was to create 3 interesting visuals from the data. We looked to
visualize locations on matches in a heatmap, describe the average goals
per game over time, and find the countries with the most wins over the
last 100+ years.

Getting Started
===============

You will need your own google api key to run these files, however,
resulting csv files are provided with the data obtained from the api if
you don't want to go that route.

Prerequisites
=============

This code requires a google api key, as well as the following python
modules: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, os, json, request, geopy, and citypy
